MyToken | ETH Proof (Beginner) This is my submission of the required Beginner ETH Proof Course project by MetaCrafters.

Description
This solidity program represents functionality that allows a user to Mint and Burn tokens from his "Balances" / Account. I have used some basic functionalities of solidity till now and will improve in the further courses provided by Metacrafters.

Getting Started
Executing program
For Mint Function: User needs to pass his "Address" and the number of tokens "values".
In Burn Function: Here too, the user needs to pass two arguments, one is his address and the second one is the number of tokens.
To check his balance, the user needs to enter his address.
Help
It is advisable to enter only positive numbers.
